# Scramble-Text-Animation
- Overview

This is a Scramble Text Animation built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that creates a constantly shifting grid of letters and symbols. The animation randomly changes characters and colors at a set speed, giving the appearance of a glitchy, digital effect. It runs smoothly on an HTML5 Canvas, ensuring high performance and responsiveness. This project is great for background visuals, artistic effects, and interactive displays.

- Features

* Random Character Shuffling – Letters and symbols change dynamically for an ever-evolving display.

* Smooth Color Transitions – Colors gradually shift for a seamless effect.

* Fully Responsive – The canvas automatically resizes to fit any screen.

* Customizable Parameters – Easily modify colors, glitch speed, and font settings.

- How It Works

The script initializes a grid of characters on the canvas based on the screen size.

At set intervals, a random selection of characters changes to new ones with a different color.

Smooth transitions interpolate between the current and target colors for a fluid effect.

The canvas automatically adjusts when the window resizes, maintaining proper spacing and alignment.
